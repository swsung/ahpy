# Decision model #

For a given decision, all alternative choices are grouped into a hierarchical model.

# Pairwise comparisons #

In order to evaluate an AHP model, all alternatives in the model must be rated. This is done via _pairwise comparisons_. In short, that means that each alternative is compared with every other alternative.

# AHP scale #

In AHP, a scale of 1 to 9 is typically used.

# Consistency ratio #

Oftentimes, people are not really consistent in making the pairwise comparisons. A measure to determine the quality of the comparisons has been devised to assess the consistency.
